Day 1 

completed network related

VPC
Subnets
internet gateways
Route tables

DAY 2

NAT Gateways:

(instane/VM/server) all same

for DBs - we connect through NAT-Gateway ( as fully secured)

No one should connect from external internet , but DB needs to connect external internet( because few upates)

we will implement NAT GW
 
 steps:
 1.create a new subnet name it as Maruti-NAT-subnet- 10.1.5.0/24
 2.Create a NAT gateway and select subnet-1
 3.Create a new routing table named as Maruti-NAT-Table and add NAT subbnet to it
 4.Ctreate  route towards NAT gateway so that all trafic sent by DB server will go to NAT gateway
 5.Deploy VM1 in public subnet 10.1.1.100 and DB1 in private subnet 10.1.5.100
 6.Try to connect DB1 server using public ip and it should fail
 7.Login to VM1 and from there connect to DB1
 8.ping wwww.google.com from DB1 and it should work
 9.Prove the data is going through NAT gateway.
 
 DAY 3
 
 Security:
 
 NACL(NETWORK ACCESS CONTROL LIST) :Subnet level: STATELESS FIREWALL
 SECURITY GROUP: INSTANCE LEVEL:STATEFULL FIREWALL:
 
 
 IDS AND IPS
 INTRUSTION DETECTION AND PREVENTION
